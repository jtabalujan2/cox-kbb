# Cox Automotive Take Home

Based on personal submissions, average time to run took 8-9 seconds. 

### Notes:
- Tried to separate and abstract functions where it made sense
   - Kept index.js (runner file) as abstracted as possible
- Most of the logic will be in comments and in either vehicle.js or common.js

### Dependencies:
- Axios
   - Used for API calls
- Statman-stopwatch
   - Used to help keep track of time required to do different portions of the script

## To Run:
1. Install dependencies 
```
npm install
```
2. Run Script
```
npm run start
```
